# SSH Terminal Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Thread Safety (Fyne call thread error)**
- **Problem**: Fyne UI operations were being called from background goroutines
- **Solution**: All Fyne operations now wrapped in `fyne.Do()` calls to ensure they run on the UI thread
- **Impact**: Eliminates "Error in Fyne call thread" errors

### 2. **Terminal Echo/Input Visibility**
- **Problem**: User input was not visible in terminal due to improper PTY setup
- **Solution**: 
  - Proper `RequestPty()` call with correct terminal modes
  - Set `ssh.ECHO: 1` to enable echoing
  - Use `session.Shell()` instead of `session.Run()` for interactive shells
- **Impact**: Users can now see what they type and interact properly with the shell

### 3. **Banner Suppression and Custom Banner**
- **Problem**: SSH login banners were cluttering the terminal output
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `banneredReader` wrapper that filters out common banner patterns
  - Adds custom banner showing connection info
  - Detects and skips common banner patterns like "Welcome to", "Last login:", etc.
- **Impact**: Clean terminal output with relevant connection information

### 4. **Proper SSH Session Management**
- **Problem**: SSH sessions were not properly configured for interactive use
- **Solution**:
  - Request PTY with proper terminal type (`xterm-256color`)
  - Set appropriate terminal modes for interactive shell
  - Use `session.Shell()` for proper interactive shell
  - Better error handling and session cleanup
- **Impact**: More reliable SSH connections and proper shell behavior

## Key Changes Made

### Updated Functions:
1. **`NewSSHMultiTerminal()`**: Complete rewrite with proper PTY setup and thread safety
2. **`CreateTerminalWidget()`**: Added PTY request and banner suppression
3. **`MultiTerminalWindow()`**: Fixed thread safety and added PTY setup

### New Components:
1. **`banneredReader`**: Custom reader that suppresses SSH banners and adds custom messages
2. **Proper terminal modes**: Added `ssh.ECHO`, `ssh.TTY_OP_ISPEED`, `ssh.TTY_OP_OSPEED`

### Thread Safety Improvements:
- All `terminal.New()` calls wrapped in `fyne.Do()`
- All `AddListener()` calls wrapped in `fyne.Do()`
- All window content setting wrapped in `fyne.Do()`
- All app quit operations wrapped in `fyne.Do()`

## Usage Example

```go
// Create terminal manager
tm := pssh.NewTerminalManager()

// Create SSH connections (assuming you have established connections)
connections := []*pssh.SSHConnection{conn1, conn2, conn3}

// Create multi-terminal (now with proper echo and banner suppression)
multiTerm, err := tm.NewSSHMultiTerminal(connections, "Multi SSH Terminal")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}

// Show terminal (blocks until window closes)
multiTerm.ShowTerminal()
```

## What You Should See Now

1. **Clean Output**: No more SSH login banners cluttering the terminal
2. **Custom Banner**: Shows "Connected to hostname (username)" for each connection
3. **Visible Input**: You can see what you type in the terminal
4. **Interactive Shell**: Proper shell interaction with command completion, history, etc.
5. **No Fyne Errors**: No more "Fyne call thread" errors in the logs
6. **Proper Echoing**: Terminal behaves like a real SSH client

## Testing

To test the improvements:
1. Run your SSH multi-terminal application
2. Start typing commands - you should see your input
3. Commands should execute properly with visible output
4. No error messages about Fyne call threads should appear
5. Banner should show custom connection info instead of system MOTD
